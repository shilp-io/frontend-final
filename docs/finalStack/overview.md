## **2. Core Architecture**
### **2.1 Layer Separation**
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles UI components and user interactions.
  - Example: `RequirementCard` component for displaying and editing requirements.
- **Application Layer**: Manages business logic, such as updating requirements and handling permissions.
  - Example: `updateRequirement` function that validates permissions and updates the database.
- **Domain Layer**: Contains domain-specific logic, such as requirement validation.
  - Example: `validateRequirement` function that enforces business rules.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Manages data access and external services.
  - Example: `RequirementRepository` class that interacts with Supabase and Redis.

### **2.2 Design Patterns**
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access logic.
  - Example: `IRequirementRepository` interface and `RequirementRepository` implementation.
- **Observer Pattern**: Facilitates real-time updates.
  - Example: `RequirementUpdateObserver` class for notifying subscribers of changes.
- **Factory Pattern**: Creates different types of requirements.
  - Example: `RequirementFactory` class for creating `FeatureRequirement`, `BugRequirement`, etc.
- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulates actions as objects.
  - Example: `UpdateRequirementCommand` class for executing and undoing updates.

## **3. State Management**
### **3.1 Zustand for UI State**
- **Local State Management**: Zustand is used for managing UI state, such as active requirements and filters.
  - Example: `useRequirementStore` for managing requirement filters and sort order.

### **3.2 React Query for Server State**
- **Server State Management**: React Query handles server-side state, such as fetching requirements and caching responses.
  - Example: `useRequirements` hook for fetching requirements based on filters and sort order.

### **3.3 Real-time Sync with Redis**
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Upstash Redis is used for real-time synchronization of changes across clients.
  - Example: `RealtimeSync` class for handling WebSocket messages and updating the UI in real-time.

## **4. Security Architecture**
### **4.1 Request Validation**
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests from a single IP.
- **Authentication**: Ensures only authenticated users can access protected resources.
- **CORS**: Restricts access to the API to trusted origins.
- **Input Validation**: Validates request payloads against predefined schemas.

### **4.2 Payment Security**
- **Stripe Webhook Validation**: Ensures the integrity of incoming webhook requests from Stripe.
  - Example: `validateStripeWebhook` function for verifying webhook signatures.

---

## **5. Data Flow**
### **5.1 Create Requirement Flow**
- **Validation**: Input data is validated against business rules.
- **Permissions**: The system checks if the user has permission to create a requirement.
- **Database Update**: The requirement is created in Supabase.
- **Cache Update**: The new requirement is cached in Redis for faster access.
- **Real-time Notification**: Team members are notified of the new requirement via WebSocket.

### **5.2 Subscription Flow**
- **Checkout Session Creation**: A Stripe checkout session is created for the user.
- **Webhook Handling**: Stripe webhooks update the subscription status in Upstash and Supabase.
- **Usage Tracking**: Upstash tracks usage and enforces rate limits based on the user's subscription plan.

---

## **6. AI Integration**
### **6.1 Requirement Analysis**
- **Context Building**: The AI analyzes requirements in the context of the project and related requirements.
- **Insight Extraction**: The AI extracts insights such as quality, completeness, and suggestions for improvement.
  - Example: `RequirementAnalyzer` class for generating AI-driven insights.

---

## **7. Real-time Collaboration**
### **7.1 Sync Manager**
- **CRDT for Conflict Resolution**: Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are used to handle concurrent edits.
- **WebSocket Communication**: Changes are synchronized between clients in real-time via WebSocket.
  - Example: `SyncManager` class for managing real-time synchronization of requirement edits.

---

## **8. Performance Optimization**
### **8.1 Query Optimization**
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed data is cached in Redis to reduce database load.
  - Example: `QueryOptimizer` class for caching query results and invalidating stale data.

### **8.2 Real-time Performance Monitoring**
- **Metrics Tracking**: The system tracks query times, render times, and network requests.
  - Example: `PerformanceMonitor` class for detecting and reporting performance issues.

---

## **9. Monitoring and Analytics**
### **9.1 Sentry Integration**
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry is used for capturing and reporting errors.
  - Example: `captureError` function for logging errors to Sentry.

### **9.2 Vercel Analytics**
- **Event Tracking**: Vercel Analytics tracks user interactions and events.
  - Example: `trackEvent` function for logging custom events.

---

## **10. Payment and Usage Verification System**
### **10.1 Payment Flow**
- **Checkout Session Creation**: A Stripe checkout session is created for the user.
- **Webhook Processing**: Stripe webhooks update the subscription status in Upstash and Supabase.

### **10.2 Usage Tracking**
- **Rate Limiting**: Upstash tracks usage and enforces rate limits based on the user's subscription plan.
- **Plan Limits Verification**: The system checks if the user's action is allowed under their current plan.

### **10.3 Subscription Status Caching**
- **Cache Layer**: Subscription status is cached in Upstash for fast access, with Supabase as a fallback.
  - Example: `SubscriptionCache` class for managing subscription status caching.

---

## **11. Implementation Examples**
### **11.1 Real-time Collaboration Component**
- **Requirement Editor**: A component for editing requirements in real-time.
  - Example: `RequirementEditor` component with WebSocket integration for real-time updates.

### **11.2 Permission-based UI**
- **Requirement Actions**: UI components that are conditionally rendered based on user permissions.
  - Example: `RequirementActions` component that shows edit and delete buttons only if the user has the necessary permissions.

---

## **12. Hosting and Deployment**
### **12.1 Vercel (MVP)**
- **Automatic Deployment**: Continuous deployment from GitHub.
- **Preview Environments**: Automatically created for each pull request.

### **12.2 Firebase (Production)**
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting with CDN for fast content delivery.
- **Functions**: Firebase Functions for server-side logic.
